\section{Abstract}
Relay is a research and design project focused in the domains of Adaptive Traffic Control and Data Visualization.
In recent years, multiple cities including Montreal and LA have begun to implement adaptive systems.
This shows a great deal of potential in maturing this technology further.
The Relay Framework is a state-of-the-art distributed traffic controller, that leverages peer-to-peer, and agent-based modelling technologies.
Intersections communicate with one another, constantly gathering and sharing information about their surroundings, and propagating local insight through the network.
When combined with powerful predictive algorithms, Relay is able to quickly adapt to changing traffic conditions.
The Relay Interface allows both traffic engineers and the general public to view detailed information about traffic conditions.
The democratization of traffic data enables a common understanding of traffic patterns within a city, allowing both public offices and citizens to make informed decisions.
By providing insightful information on intersection statistics and traffic patterns, the Relay Interface offers a window into cities that has never been seen before.

\section{Background Information}
Motorists and pedestrians alike can relate to the frustration that comes from being stopped unnecessarily at a red light, waiting for it to turn green with no other cars in sight.
The intelligence of a traffic light can vary from a static, fixed timer, to a relatively intelligent node which considers existing traffic conditions, the performance of adjacent nodes, and the like.
Large metropolitan areas are acknowledging the need for advanced traffic management systems as the size and density of urban areas continues to increase.
Over the past 29 years, the city of Los Angeles has developed a home-grown solution to handle the massive amounts of volume placed on their transportation networks, at an estimated cost of \$400 million to date \cite{la-atcs-article}.
The City of Montreal recently signed to adopt Transcore's TransSuite Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), which will control over 2000 intersections by completion \cite{montreal-transcore}.
There is strong need for ATCS technology in the world today, and there is a large opportunity for state-of-the-art ATC systems.

There are many industry-accepted and adopted ATC systems, such as LA ATCS, SCOOT, Trafficware, Spectrum by Miovision, InSync by Rhythm Engineering, Glide, ACS Lite by Centracs, and TransCore.
However, high implementation costs are often a deterrent from implementing such systems.
Significant advancements in Adaptive Traffic Control systems have been seen in academia.
Research efforts have been made towards novel architectures such as agent-based distributed systems which implement advanced machine learning and neural network concepts\cite{1688100, 5073360, uot-article}.
A large gap between academia and industry still exists however, showing potential for cutting edge solutions to be incorporated into common municipal infrastructure.

\section{Problem}
%maybe change this to just a problem statement to shorten it

Access to the data from ATCS systems is largely kept for internal analysis by the government organizations, suffocating further technological development by industrial and academic organizations.
No existing systems offer consumer access to the system's data in any form.
The solution must meet the needs of transportation authorities, who will be responsible for overseeing the performance and maintenance of the system, and are ultimately responsible for the system.
The solution must also meet the needs of the population which it serves, providing transparent access to its operation and allowing consumers to take full advantage of the information.
The advantages of the system should be apparent and noticeable by both stakeholders, and finally, the system must be reliable and robust, due to the severe safety and efficiency consequences of failure and poor performance. The Relay system will be a proof of concept for \emph{democratic}, distributed intelligent traffic control systems.

%something about the backend stuff
In essence, there currently exists no industry-accepted Adaptive Traffic Control System, which adequately meets current and future transportation demands on urban road networks.

%brief overview of what is provided
The Relay Interface has helped redefine the value of Adaptive Traffic Control System Interfaces. For Traffic Engineers, the application enables the shift of responsibility and value from signal timing and tweaking, to network monitoring and informed planning. Relay Interface exposes rich information which was previously either impossible or extremely expensive to collect, greatly reducing costs associated with maintaining efficiency of the network. This information allows traffic engineers to know exactly what's going on in the network at any moment. Through the use of geospatial data visualizations, the application is able to reveal high-level traffic patterns, providing invaluable insight into the workings of a city's transportation network. Access to this kind of information has the potential to change the way public infrastructure decisions are made. This project should serve as a guide for the development of Adaptive Traffic Control System Interfaces in the future.

\section{Impact}
Adaptive Traffic Control Systems have many positive social and environmental implications as a byproduct of improving traffic flow through a city.
A few of these are decreased gas consumption, reduced travel time, and reduced congestion.
It is important to note that these are not direct goals of the implementation, but rather beneficial external consequences of effective traffic control, that naturally extend from effectively adapting signal timings.
The proposed solution thus focuses on local intersection performance, which in turn contributes to the improvement of aforementioned social and environmental benefits.

\section{Conclusions}

The push for democratized traffic data is a major goal for this project, and Relay Interface serves as a first major attempt to present infrastructure-quality traffic information to the public. Relay Interface allows the public to examine and understand the workings of their public infrastructure, encouraging a more informed and engaged population.
