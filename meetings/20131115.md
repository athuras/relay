## Topic: Write some stuff

* Write some of the models
* Think about how stuff can be simulated/tested

### 1. Local Intersection

If we want to stay within the Python Ecosystem (which we do for the prototype), the use of NetworkX is ideal, (because we have a lot of control over how the graph is defined). That said, igraph renders some nicer images than matplotlib (for demo purposes).

### 2. Simulation/Testing
