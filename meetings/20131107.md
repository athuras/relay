## Alex + Riley
Earlier in the afternoon Riley and I (Alex) brainstormed about the interface, and how we can actively demonstrate the system working.

We agreed that working with Vissim would involve a lot of overhead and should be avoided as much as possible.

## Alex + Scott + Myles
Mostly setting up the devlopment environments for all those involved in preparation for the next work session.
