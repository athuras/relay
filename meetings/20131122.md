# 2013-11-22: Doing 'work'.

## relay_flask:
* put in place the barebones flask app for the web interface

## relay_maps:

Currently based off of OpenStreetMaps, with potential for switching to Google Maps.
Did a bunch of research on web map tiling resources, resulted in using leaflet.js as our javascript mapping framework.
The flask app will send a page that renders a map (using leaflet).
Drawing interface stuff on top should be a simple as rendering GIS-located polygons on top of the map.

### Further Notes:
I am currently using a free CloudMade.com account for the use of their tiling API key, as well as it is the resource referenced by leaflet.js.
