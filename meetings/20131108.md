## Topic: Getting the ball rolling

We brain stormed about the intersection model.
i.e. its a graph, where lanes are nodes, and 'paths' are edges.

## Things to implement:

### 1. Local Intersection Graph

We need to write the machinery to implement the local intersection model. Keeping it general, and only tying in the *macro-edges* at the end.

* f: L -> S
* h: given subsets of S, filters the legal ones, which are now called V_i.
* g: V_i -> A_i

Where:
* L = {Lanes}
* S = {Edges}, subset of the complete graph G(L, S)
* V^hat = all subsets of S
* V_i = all legal elements in V^hat
* A_i = subsets of L. The light bulbs them selves. Each element is a light bulb to turn on.


### 2. Macro-Graph Tie-in.
