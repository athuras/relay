- hotness of a road/intersection indicates # of cars there
	use our prediction data to estimate number of cars on the road
	"hotness" refers to "cool" colours (blue, purple) vs. "warm" colours (yellow, orange, red)
	each car is modelled with a colored dot

- 3 to 5 map markers show the busiest intersections at a given time
- hover over a marker to view a popup dialog
	dialog shows intersection name, phase of lights, and a 'more' button to open the side menu
	click any intersection to view the popup dialog

- click the buttons in the top right (in the header) to show/hide various data layers

- show/hide graphs in the side menu by clicking the "eye" icon
- click the right facing arrow in the top left of the side menu to close the menu

- currently showing "capacity" and "performance" as placeholder data
	other metrics to consider:
		overall delay (amount of time spent in network)
		queue lengths - max, average
		side street delay vs. major street delay
		travel time along artery weighted vs side street delays
		number of stops (may be hard to measure)
	these may be good additions to the side menu
		need to consider what data works well for on the map,
		and what is better portrayed through numbers/charts in the side bar.
		Also what works for both!
